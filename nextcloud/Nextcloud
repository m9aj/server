    Accessing site insecurely via HTTP. You are strongly advised to set up your server to require HTTPS instead. Without it some important web functionality like "copy to clipboard" or "service workers" will not work! For more details see the documentation ↗.

    Server has no maintenance window start time configured. This means resource intensive daily background jobs will also be executed during your main usage time. We recommend to set it to a time of low usage, so users are less impacted by the load caused from these heavy tasks. For more details see the documentation ↗.

    One or more mimetype migrations are available. Occasionally new mimetypes are added to better handle certain file types. Migrating the mimetypes take a long time on larger instances so this is not done automatically during upgrades. Use the command `occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive` to perform the migrations.

  su -m www-data -c 'php occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive'

    Some headers are not set correctly on your instance - The `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP header is not set (should be at least `15552000` seconds). For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable HSTS. For more details see the documentation ↗.

    Detected some missing optional indices. Occasionally new indices are added (by Nextcloud or installed applications) to improve database performance. Adding indices can sometimes take awhile and temporarily hurt performance so this is not done automatically during upgrades. Once the indices are added, queries to those tables should be faster. Use the command `occ db:add-missing-indices` to add them. Missing indices: "systag_by_objectid" in table "systemtag_object_mapping". For more details see the documentation ↗.

docker exec -u www-data -it nextcloud-app bash

  su -m www-data -c 'php occ db:add-missing-indices'

    The database is used for transactional file locking. To enhance performance, please configure memcache, if available. For more details see the documentation ↗.

    Your installation has no default phone region set. This is required to validate phone numbers in the profile settings without a country code. To allow numbers without a
